Execution Instructions:

Run the program by providing the command line input (testing_data.csv file)

$ python firewall.py testing_data.csv

If you are giving any other testing '.csv' file, then:

$ python firewall.py [your_file_name]

For running test_scripts on the created file, please execute

$ pytest -q test.py (which uses the 'testing_data.csv' file automatically)

Important Note:

In this assignment i used pandas library and data frames. I am currently working as Research Assistant at Arizona State University under the Professor.
I have worked on several tasks like Collecting and analyzing real-time data-sets for training Models, data-cleaning, classification & regression Analysis, clustering data using K-Means, Spectral Clustering and finding efficient algorithmâ€™s for improving accuracy of learning models upon test data.
Therefore, i have utilized my current knowledge on data pre-processing to solve this coding challenge using data_frames. I performed different steps in solving this problem, where in each step i choose to use the method of elimination to filter out data which do not match the given criteria. To check weather the given port number and ip_address are in port range and ip_address range, i have implemented two functions
'portCheck' and 'ipCheck'.
